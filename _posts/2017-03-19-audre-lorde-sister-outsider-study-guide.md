## Essay Summaries

### Notes from a Trip to Russia

In 1976, Audre Lorde made a trip to Russia as the American observer for the Union of Soviet Writers' African-Asian Writers Conference. This essay is an account of her travels and experiences over the course of this two-week trip. Lorde begins the essay by recounting several dreams she has had since returning from her trip to Russia. She states that in her dreams "Russia became a mythic representation of that socialism which does not yet exist anywhere I have been" (p. 13). She mentions that her impression of Russia is that of a place with different opportunities and challenges to offer than the United States.

* What surprised or stood out to you about Lorde's depiction of Russia?
* Do you have any personal experience traveling to a new place, or reading about one, and having that challenge your view of how society can or should be structured?

### Poetry is Not a Luxury

In Poetry Is Not a Luxury, Audre Lorde defines poetry as something vital and necessary to the human (especially female) condition, and a source of our power and action, rather than a leisure activity.

"For women, then, poetry is not a luxury. It is a vital necessity of our existence. It forms the quality of the light within which we predicate our hopes and dreams toward survival and change, first made into language, then into idea, then into more tangible action."

She sets poetry, Blackness, femininity, and "feelings" in opposition to white male European focus on "ideas" defined by profit, by linear power, and by institutional dehumanization.

"The white fathers told us: I think, therefore I am. The Black mother within each of us – the poet – whispers in our dreams: I feel, therefore I can be free."

"Kept around as unavoidable adjuncts or pleasant pastimes, feelings were expected to kneel to thought as women were expected to kneel to men. But women have survived. As poets."

* Were there any passages that stood out to you and why?
* What do you think Lorde meant by her statement, "there are no new ideas?"
* What do you think about her juxtaposition of thinking/feeling, white/Black, European/non-European, man/woman?

### The Transformation of Silence into Language and Action

This essay is a talk Audre Lorde gave at the Modern Language Association's "Lesbian and Literature Panel" in 1977. Lorde begins by talking about her benign breast tumor surgery and how this brush with death gave her perspective over her fear of speaking up. Silence, to Lorde, merely allows injustices to go unheard and fears to remain powerful. While she recognizes that, especially for Black women, visibility means vulnerability, she believes that clinging to silence as a means of protection is ineffective and destructive.

"For to survive in the mouth of this dragon we call america, we have had to learn this first and most vital lesson – that we were never meant to survive. Not as human beings. And neither were most of you here today, Black or not. And that visibility which makes us most vulnerable is that which also is the source of our greatest strength. Because the machine will try to grind you into dust anyway, whether or not we speak. We can sit in our corners mute forever while our sisters and our selves are wasted, while our children are distorted and destroyed, while our earth is poisoned; we can sit in our safe corners mute as bottles, and we will still be no less afraid."

*  What are your thoughts on the perceived ability of silence to "protect" us from what we fear?
*  Is Lorde saying that all women have the responsibility to speak up, even when it means facing a fear of "judgment, of pain, of death"?
    * Is it fair to place this responsibility on women?

### Scratching the Surface: Some Notes on Barriers to Women and Loving

At the beginning of Scratching the Surface, Audre Lorde defines four words—racism, sexism, heterosexism, and homophobia—and then identifies all four as "forms of human blindness." She talks about the American Black community in this context, pointing out how those in power benefit by encouraging horizontal hostility with these forms of blindness.

For example, she talks about how sexism is used in university settings to pit Black men against Black women in hiring – saying that women are "taking jobs away from Black men." This creates a barrier to solidarity that prevents Black people from coming together to focus on the vertical battle against racist economic, political and social forces.

*  How do you think Lorde believes oppressed communities can move beyond these forms of "human blindness?" Is it through personal transformation, or otherwise? Do you agree?

### Uses of the Erotic: The Erotic as Power

Lorde defines the erotic as not merely sexual, but a "female lifeforce" of spiritual creative power and harmony. She says that in order for oppression to perpetuate itself, it must "corrupt or distort" sources of power within the oppressed. For women within the context of male models of power, that has meant suppression of the erotic.

"The principal horror of any system which defines the good in terms of profit rather than in terms of human need, or which defines human need to the exclusion of the psychic and emotional components of that need – the principal horror of such a system is that it robs our work of its
erotic value, its erotic power and life appeal and fulfillment."

For Lorde, the importance of the erotic is far beyond sexuality. The erotic is a tool to "inform an illuminate our actions" by recognizing our feelings, making us "less willing to accept powerlessness...despair, self-effacement, depression, self-denial." In this way, she believes
embracing the erotic is embracing power to create change "in the face of a racist, patriarchal, and anti-erotic society."

*  What did you think of the way Lorde defined "the erotic"? Would you have defined it the same way?
*  Lorde also defines pornography as the opposite of the erotic, for it "emphasizes sensation without feeling." What did you think of this definition?

### Sexism: An American Disease in Blackface

This essay was first published in The Black Scholar in 1979 as a direct response to an article by Robert Staples published in the same journal earlier that year called The Myth of Black Macho: A Response to Angry Black Feminists. The tone of the essay is confrontational. Lorde accuses Staples of attacking Black feminists and Black women as a threat rather than as potential allies, urging a refocusing on larger societal issues such as racism and capitalism.

"If this society ascribes roles to Black men which they are not allowed to fulfill, is it Black women who must bend and alter our lives to compensate, or is it society that needs changing? And why should Black men accept these roles as correct ones, or anything other than a narcotic promise encouraging acceptance of other facets of their own oppression?"

"The results of woman-hating in the Black community are tragedies which diminish all Black people. These acts must be seen in the context of a systematic devaluation of Black women within this society. It is within this context that we become approved and acceptable targets for Black male rage, so acceptable that even a Black male social scientist condones and excuses this depersonalizing abuse.

This abuse is no longer acceptable to Black women in the name of solidarity, nor of Black liberation. Any dialogue between Black women and Black men must begin there, no matter where it ends."

### An Open Letter to Mary Daly

An Open Letter to Mary Daly is a letter that Audre Lorde wrote to Mary Daly, the white female author of the feminist work Gyn/Ecology: The Metaethics of Radical Feminism. The letter challenges Daly's portrayal of Black women's experience from the book – how she used only white, western European, judeo-christian goddess images, while portraying non-european women as victims in discussions such as genital mutilation.  She points out how this dismissal distorts and trivializes Black women's experience, calling it "another instance of the knowledge, crone-ology and work of women of Color being ghettoized by a white woman dealing only out of a patriarchal western European frame of reference."

She also points out how one cannot claim to speak for "women's experience" without examining other forms of oppression such as racism.  She gives a few medical examples of how racism operates as a force in the lives of Black women, such as their 3x higher 80 percent fatality rate from breast cancer.

"The oppression of women knows no ethnic nor racial boundaries, true, but that does not mean it is identical within those differences...To deal with one without even alluding to the other is to distort our commonality as well as our difference."

### Man Child: A Black Lesbian Feminist's Response

In this essay, Lorde acknowledges that raising a boy has a unique set of challenges for her as a lesbian feminist, as " the sons of lesbians have to make their own definitions of self as men." She also defines her vision for her son that acknowledges the intersecting challenges of racism and sexism.

"I wish to raise a Black man who will not be destroyed by, nor settle for, those corruptions called power by the white fathers who mean his destruction as surely as they mean mine. I wish to raise a Black man who will recognize that the legitimate objects of his hostility are not women, but the particulars of a structure that programs him to fear and despise women as well as his own Black self."

Part of this for Lorde is teaching her son to "feel deeply" for himself and to see power as something other than "might, age privilege, or the lack of fear." She says that "societal destruction begins when he is forced to believe that he can only be strong if he doesn't feel, or if he wins."

*  What perspectives do you have on Lorde's approach to feminist parenting? Do you agree with her approach? Do you have any experiences to share?

### An Interview: Audre Lorde and Adrienne Rich

This interview gives the reader more background on Lorde and her style of writing and analysis. For example, how her focus on poetry developed as a child, her experiences in Mexico, and critiques of her work such as "Poetry is Not a Luxury."

In one exchange, Rich addresses the critique that Lorde is "simply restating the old stereotype of the rational white male and the emotional dark female" in her work. Lorde responds by saying she is not giving province of intelligence and rationality to white males, but saying that it is meaningless without its counterpart of feeling. "The Black mother who is the poet exists in every one of us. Now when males or patriarchal thinkers (whether male or female) reject that combination, then we're truncated." She doesn't see feel/think as a dichotomy, but as a "choice of ways and combinations."

### The Master's Tools Will Never Dismantle the Master's House

This essay was presented as a speech at "The Personal and the Political Panel" at the Second Sex Conference in New York, and she starts off by pointing out that at the conference, there are only two Black women speakers, both of whom were found "at the last hour." She accuses white American feminists of claiming to represent change for all women, while still operating in a racist, homophobic value structure that silences poor women, Black and Third World women, lesbians, and other oppressed groups.

"What does it mean when the tools of a racist patriarchy are used to examine the fruits of that same patriarchy? It means that only the most narrow perimeters of change are possible and allowable."

"For the master's tools will never dismantle the master's house. They may allow us temporarily to beat him at his own game, but they will never enable us to bring about genuine change. And this fact is only threatening to those women who still define the master's house as their only source of support."

*  What does Lorde really mean when she says "master's tools"? What does she think is an alternative? Do you agree with her assessment that "the master's tools will never dismantle the master's house"?
*  This essay uses the lack of diversity at a conference as a jumping off point – a common critique in Silicon Valley. Do you have any stories or experiences addressing issues of representation at your organizations?

### Age, Race, Class, and Sex: Women Redefining Difference

Audre Lorde begins this essay by restating some themes common in her works: that America is a society based around profit rather than human need; that, in this society, one tool of oppression is the expectation that the oppressed person must explain him or herself to the oppressor.  This is a redirection of energy that could be used for action and change.

Additionally, she addresses the "institutionalized rejection of difference" necessary in a profit economy. Only in a world where we believe that difference gives some people the right to dominate others can "surplus people" exist to be profited from.

She urges women to "identify and develop new definitions of power and new patterns of relating across difference." This requires recognizing differences as neither inferior nor superior, but devising ways to use difference as a strength and tool to help "dismantle the master's house."

### The Uses of Anger: Women Responding to Racism

In this essay, Audre Lorde specifically addresses women who have a problem with the anger of black women responding to racism. Her primary reaction to racism, she says, is anger—which is an appropriate reaction to injustice. She believes that this anger is incredibly useful and can be a tool for growth, but only if women are committed to listening to and learning from the genuine anger of others without guilt or defensiveness.

"Anger expressed and translated into action in the service of our vision and our future is a liberating and strengthening act of clarification, for it is in the painful process of this translation that we identify who are our allies with whom we have grave differences, and who are our genuine enemies."

"...guilt is just another name for impotence, for defensiveness destructive of communication; it becomes a device to protect ignorance and the continuation of things the way they are, the ultimate protection for changelessness."

### Learning from the 60s

In Learning from the 60s, Lorde focuses on Malcolm X and how the anger of the Black community was often expressed horizontally towards each other rather than vertically. She critiques how the Black movement sought to create unity through homogeneity instead of by embracing difference. She believes that if we are to move forward, oppressed people must also fight the internalized oppression: "we cannot afford to do our enemies' work by destroying each other."

### Eye to Eye: Black Women, Hatred, and Anger

This essay examines black women's anger and how it is expressed toward each other. Lorde begins by saying that all black women have an inner reserve of anger, and that she has spent her life learning to express her own anger rather than suppress it. She has also noticed, however, that this anger seems most easily expressed toward other black women.  She begins exploring this issue by noting that black women absorb the hatred of society from a young age, and even learn to feed off of it.  She gives several examples of instances in which she gradually became aware of white people's hatred of her as a child.

### Grenada Revisited: An Interim Report

Audre Lorde first visited Grenada, the homeland of her mother, in 1979, before the New Jewel Movement's bloodless coup that ended the U.S.-sanctioned, corrupt regime that had been in place and replaced it with the People's Revolutionary Government. She describes how, after her first visit, the People's Revolutionary Government made various improvements on the island.

At the time of the writing of Grenada Revisited, Lorde visits Grenada in fear that its simple beauty and way of life has been ravaged by the U.S. invasion of the island two months before her visit. She lists a series of lies that the U.S. government has told about the invasion which do not hold up under scrutiny. Lorde cites various ways in which the U.S. sought to keep Grenada dependent.
