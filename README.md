# SF Feminist Book Club

This is a repository for the [San Francisco Feminist Book Club](https://radicalbarracuda.github.io/sf-feminist-book-club)!

## Mission
Our mission is to open source all of the materials and study guides we make for book club and other book club resources we use like our group discussion facilitation guidelines.

## Local Development

Make sure you have ruby and the bundler gem installed. [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#homebrew-on-mac-os-x) is a good utility to manage different environments with distinct ruby versions.

```
gem install bundler
```

Install Jekyll and other necessary gems.

```
bundle install
```

Start Jekyll
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
For more information about Jekyll development, check out the [usage documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/) on the platform's site.
