## Local Development

Make sure you have ruby and the bundler gem installed. [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#homebrew-on-mac-os-x) is a good utility to manage different environments with distinct ruby versions.

```
gem install bundler
```

Install Jekyll and other necessary gems.

```
bundle install
```

Start Jekyll
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
For more information about Jekyll development, check out the [usage documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/) on the platform's site.
