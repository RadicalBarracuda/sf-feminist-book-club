# Feminism Without Borders (Introduction + Ch. 1)
## by Chandra Talpade Mohanty
 
## Introduction

### Decolonization, Anticapitalist Critique, and Feminist Commitments

In the introduction, Mohanty introduces her concept of “feminism without borders” and her vision for a feminist future.
 
 > Borders suggest both containment and safety, and women often pay a price for daring to claim the integrity, security, and safety of our bodies and our living spaces. I choose ‘feminism without borders,’ then, to stress that our most expansive and inclusive versions of feminism need to be attentive to borders while learning to transcend them.

**Questions:**
- What do you think she means by this statement? Do you agree/disagree? Any anecdotes to share?
- How would you define your own borders? Ones you’ve observed, crossed or been bound by?

Mohanty also describes here her feminist vision:

> … this is a vision of the world that is pro-sex and –woman, a world where women and men are free to live creative lives, in security and with bodily health and integrity, where they are free to choose whom they love, and whom they set up house with, and whether they want to have or not have children; a world where pleasure rather than duty and drudgery determine our choices, where free and imaginative exploration of the mind is a fundamental right; a vision in which economic stability, ecological sustainability, racial equality, and the redistribution of wealth form the material basis of people’s well-being. Finally, my vision is one in which democratic and socialist practices and institutions provide the conditions for public participation and decision making for people regardless of economic and social location.

**Questions:**

- What are your opinions on this vision? If you could snap your fingers and remake the world as a feminist utopia, what would it look like? 

## Chapter 1

### Under Western Eyes: Feminist Scholarship and Colonial Discourses

This chapter comes down to Mohanty resisting the urge of Western scholars to put Third World women in a box, defining them as a monolithic group in opposition to the ‘secular, liberated’ West. This is what she means by the “colonialization” of feminist theory.

> The average Third World woman leads an essentially truncated life based on her feminine gender (read: sexually constrained) and her being “Third World” (read: ignorant, poor, uneducated, tradition-bound, domestic, family-oriented, victimized, etc.). This, I suggest, is in contrast to the (implicit) self-representation of Western women as educated, as modern, as having control over their own bodies and sexualities and the freedom to make their own decisions.

> If this were material reality, there would be no need for political movements in the West.

She goes on to critique the generalization of all women into a monolithic group, arguing that writers can only get things right if they pay attention to the specific social and historical circumstances of the women they’re describing.

> Sisterhood cannot be assumed on the basis of gender; it must be forged in concrete historical and political practice and analysis.

For example, the practice of veiling can have a very different significance for women depending on its historical context. Iranian middle-class women veiled themselves during the 1979 revolution to indicate solidarity with their veiled, working-class sisters – a revolutionary gesture - while in contemporary Iran, mandatory Islamic laws dictate that all Iranian women wear veils. Thus, it’s completely useless to assert a monolithic interpretation of veiling if you’re trying to create a political strategy.

**Questions:**

- Do you agree/disagree with Mohanty’s description of how Third World women are portrayed and the ramifications? 
- Do you see signs of what Mohanty describes in your own reading or experience (fiction or nonfiction)? 

## Chapter 2

### Cartographies of Struggle: Third World Women and the Politics of Feminism

What IS Third World feminism? How can you define it without defining a strict definition of Third World women? For that matter, how do you define feminism without a strict definition of how to define women?

> After all, there is no logical and necessary connection between being female and becoming feminist

> …it is the common context of struggles against specific exploitative structures and systems that determines our potential political alliances.

Then there is the recognition that Third World / women of color feminism is necessarily different from White feminism because of the different history of struggle.

> In fact, the challenge of Third World feminisms to white, Western feminisms has been precisely this inescapable link between feminist and political liberation movements. In fact, black, white and other Third World women have very different histories with respect to the particular inheritance of post-fifteenth-century Euro-American hegemony: the inheritance of slavery, enforced migration, plantation and indentured labor, colonialism, imperial conquest, and genocide.

She gives the example of reproductive rights and the history of race- and class-based history of population control and sterilization abuse, which results in women of color having a different relationship to the abortion rights platform. For white feminists, the core issue has often been a matter of men vs. women – for example, husbands or doctors restricting the right of their wives to have an abortion. But for women of color, institutional and state policies HAVE to be part of the discussion if feminism is going to be relevant for them.

> For poor women of color, the notion of a ‘woman’s right to choose’ to bear children has always been mediated by a coercive, racist state. Thus, abortion rights defined as a woman’s right versus men’s familial control can never be the only basis of feminist coalitions across race and class lines. For many women of color, reproductive rights conceived in its broadest form, in terms of familial male/female relationships, but also, more significantly, in terms of institutional relationships and state policies, must be the basis for such coalitions.

Just as feminism is relevant for both men and women, so racism is relevant for both white people and people of color.

She also defines **intersectional feminism** here:

> But no one ‘becomes a woman’ (in Simone de Beauvoir’s sense) purely because she is female. Ideologies of womanhood have as much to do with class and race as they have to do with sex. Thus, during the period of American slavery, constructions of white womanhood as chaste, domesticated, and morally pure had everything to do with corresponding constructions of black slave women as promiscuous, available plantation workers. It is in the intersections of the various systemic networks of class, race (hetero)sexuality, and nation, then, that position us as ‘women.’

She also outlines how the state and state power institutionalizes racism and sexism and requests a refocusing on the “practices of ruling” – the process or form of ruling – vs. static indicators of inequalities the ruling has produced.

> The embodiment of power is the institutialization of it – through the production of stereotypes (English Gentleman), knowledge (evolutionary anthropology), myths, etc. (59)

All of this is a critique of capitalism. In colonialism, the states created racially and sexually differentiated classes so they could have a ruling process fundamentally grounded in economic surplus extraction (profits). They did this by institutionalizing ideologies that legitimated their processes of ruling (61). It “naturalizes” and abstracts race and gender to legitimize the ruling process.

She goes on to illustrate this connection between profit and the exploitation specifically of immigrant people of color in the US – white men were “free labor” and could take any job. Black men and women were used as slaves, Mexican-Americans were paid much lower wages for their work. (67) Racial categorization is very dependent on labor needs – anyone who we needed to exploit / it was profitable to exploit became racialized. Chinese were considered “Indian” in order to put them in a category of a different race so that they could be a cheap source of labor.

### Anthropology and the Third World Woman as “Native”

The discipline of anthropology can trace its origins straight to colonialism and is fundamentally gendered and racial – taking at its center white, Western masculinity. Scholarship can be both a form of rule and a form of resistence. Knowledge production can be used by the dominators to reinforce their position, and it can be used by the colonized to take back their own definitions of self.

### Consciousness, Identity, Writing

For Mohanty, writing is crucial to consciousness-raising.

> Testimonials, life stories, and oral histories are a significant mode of remembering / recording experience. The very practice of remembering and rewriting leads to the formation of political consciousness and self-identity. Writing often becomes the context through which new political identities are forged. It becomes a space for struggle and contestation about reality itself. 

> If the everyday world is not transparent and its relations of rule – its organizations and institutional frameworks – work to obscure and make invisible inherent hierarchies of power, it becomes imperative that we rethink, remember, and utilize our lived relations as a basis of knowledge. Writing (discursive production) is one site for the production of this knowledge and this consciousness.

She talks about the uprooting of “dualistic thinking” – a “consciousness of the borderlands” that allows us to see ambiguities and contradictions clearly, and to act collectively.
