**Introduction Question:** Was there any one chapter that stood out to you or challenged your view of feminism, and why?

## Overview

In _Feminism is for Everybody_, bell hooks sought to write a concise, easy to understand answer to the question "what is feminist politics?" She provides a history of the second wave feminist movement through the 1960s and 1970s and explores her vision for a more radical feminist future.

## Chapter Summaries

### Introduction: Come Closer to Feminism

In her introduction, hooks defines feminism as "a movement to end sexism, sexist exploitation, and oppression." Importantly, feminism is not about being anti-male and it is not a movement _for_ women and _against_ men. And while males as a group may benefit most from any perceived superiority patriarchy provides, it's important to understand that females are often socialized to be just as sexist as men.

For bell hooks, feminism is, as the title suggests, a movement for everybody:

> Imagine living in a world where there is no domination, where females and males are not alike or even always equal, but where a vision of mutuality is the ethos shaping our interaction. Imagine living in a world where we can all be who we are, a world of peace and possibility. Feminist revolution alone will not create such a world; we need to end racism, class elitism, imperialism. But it will make it possible for us to be fully self-actualized females and males able to create beloved community, to live together, realizing our dreams of freedom and justice, living the truth that we are all â€˜created equal.'

**Discussion Questions:**

- Were you surprised by hooks' definition of feminism?
- Did this definition change or affect your previous understanding of what feminism means or represents?
- Why do you think she makes a point to call out that feminism isn't enough - that we also need to work to end racism, class elitism, and imperialism? Do you agree?

### 1: Feminist Politics: Where We Stand

In this chapter, hooks describes the history of feminism as a set of political beliefs, and some history on different feminist schools of thought. She describes 3 flavors of feminist politics: Reformist feminism, Radical feminism, and Lifestyle feminism.

#### Reformist Feminism

Most people's understanding of feminist politics is what she calls Reformist feminism. At its core, Reformist feminism is about women achieving class mobility within the existing system, and it has been heavily critiqued as a way for economically advantaged women to ally with and benefit from the existing patriarchal system without fundamentally challenging it.

The equal pay for equal work movement during the 1960s-70s is a prime example. Demanding access to the workforce never quite make sense for Black and immigrant women who had _always_ been in the workforce. Similarly, equal pay for equal work only made sense for middle class white women whose white male counterparts were already economically advantaged.

By ignoring issues of race and class, many white, middle class women of this "second wave" feminist movement alienated women along class and racial lines. How could feminism be a movement for all women, when its political goals only seemed to benefit a small subset of white, middle class women?

#### Revolutionary Feminism

bell hooks describes Revolutionary feminism (what today we would call intersectional feminism) as the political answer to these race and class tensions in Reformist feminist thinking.  Revolutionary feminists are committed to bringing an end to patriarchy and sexism via an _overall_ restructuring of society. It asserts that feminist politics cannot be based on the exploitation and oppression of others by any means - be that by gender, class, race, or otherwise. While reformist politics may help to benefit _some_ individual women, we ultimately need to work towards a restructuring of society and economy as fundamentally anti-sexist if we want to build a movement for _all_ women.

#### Lifestyle Feminism

bell hooks describes Lifestyle feminism to challenge the notion that all women are feminists simply by virtue of identifying as female.  Lifestyle feminism is the notion that there can be as many versions of feminism as there are women. Instead of a political commitment, feminism becomes a kind of lifestyle - a cool "THE FUTURE IS FEMALE" t-shirt that any woman can wear without fundamentally challenging and changing themselves or the culture. For hooks, this is not OK. Feminism is a political commitment to end oppression, not something you are born into.

hooks gives the controversial example of abortion:

> If feminism is a movement to end sexist oppression, and depriving females of reproductive rights is a form of sexist oppression, then one cannot be anti-choice and be feminist. A woman can insist she would never choose to have an abortion while affirming her support of the right of women to choose and still be an advocate of feminist politics. She cannot be anti-abortion and an advocate of feminism.

**Discussion Questions:**

- Do you agree with hooks that feminism is a commitment to specific politics, not an "identity" that can belong to all women?
- What did you think about her pointing out a very specific political commitment - reproductive choice - as defining issue in feminist politics? Do you think a woman can be anti-choice and still "feminist"?

### 2: Consciousness-Raising: A Constant Change of Heart

In this chapter, hooks examines how Reformist feminism became institutionalized - silencing the movement's early radical beginnings in small feminist consciousness-raising groups. Because poorer, working class leaders in the feminist movement were less likely to have PhDs, university women's studies programs ended up adopting the reformist politics of mainly white, middle class women. Once women's studies came to the classroom in the form of reformist politics, you suddenly got a wave of privileged women entering the workforce using the jargon of feminism. Instead of learning about feminist politics and confronting their own internalized sexism, privileged women focused on gender equality specifically for class mobility - often at the expense of other women.

She asserts that consciousness-raising groups are crucially important for both women and men to understand how they have internalized sexist thinking. She makes a point to address men specifically, arguing that they especially need a space to therapeutically address how sexism has negatively affected their lives, to feel affirmed and valued, and to help them understand that feminism is anti-sexism, not anti-male.

**Discussion Questions:**

- Did you already know about the feminist consciousness-raising groups of the 60s and 70s? Do you think something like that would still be relevant today, for women or men?

### 3: Sisterhood Is Still Powerful

In this chapter, hooks addresses how feminism makes true solidarity between women possible. One way that sexism is internalized is that women see themselves as always and only in competition with one another for (patriarchal) male approval. This creates an atmosphere of jealousy, fear, and hatred. By helping women to unlearn this female self-hatred, it enables women to bond with each other in an affirmative way.

Importantly, she defines female solidarity as going beyond "positive recognition of the experiences of women" or "shared sympathy for common suffering." In other words, it's not about bonding over the mere experience of being female. Instead, it is about engaging in _political_ solidarity - a shared commitment against patriarchal, class, and racial injustice.

As an example of this kind of solidarity, she describes a feminist response for women with class privilege when hiring domestic help:

> Some of those women successfully created positive bonding between themselves and the women they hired so that there could be mutual advancement in a larger context of inequality. Rather than abandoning the vision of sisterhood, because they could not attain some Utopian state, they created a real sisterhood, one that took into account the needs of everyone involved. This was the hard work of feminist solidarity between women.

**Discussion Questions:**

- What do you think it means for women to "break free of patriarchal thinking"? What effect would it have (if any) if all women did so?
- Based on bell hooks' assertion that real female solidarity can only be built on a rejection of patriarchal thinking, can we build solidarity with non-feminist women? What would that mean or look like?

### 4: Feminist Education for Critical Consciousness

Why is it that women and men have to be "educated" about sexism anyway? For hooks, the answer lies in the fact that most people just don't take the time to challenge the root of their perceptions. In fact, even challenging the current "common sense" about why things are the way they are is REALLY difficult when those ways have been institutionalized in an already sexist, racist, classist society. (For example: Explaining why only books written by men were studied in literature courses.)

This is why she believes that academic work on feminist theory is particularly important. It gives us a body of research and study to explain how the world works and challenge the status quo. At the same time, academic work is often very inaccessible in language and format, and a truly _revolutionary_ movement must be accessible to all people.

Because of this, hooks pushes for accessible feminist theory that goes far beyond academic settings:

> Imagine a mass-based feminist movement where folks go door to door passing out literature, taking the time (as do religious groups) to explain to people what feminism is all about.

>  Books on tape, songs, radio, and television are all ways to share feminist knowledge. And of course we need a feminist television network, which is not the same as a network for women. Galvanizing funds to create a feminist television network would help us spread feminist thinking globally.

**Discussion Questions:**

- Is there anything in your life you wish you could examine more, to find the "root" of why you think, feel, or act a certain way?
- What do you think about hooks' strategies (A feminist TV network! Songs! Radio!) to disperse feminist education?

### 5: Our Bodies, Ourselves: Reproductive Rights

Reproductive rights has since the beginning been a cornerstone of the feminist movement. It has also been a point of contention and is almost always associated exclusively with the right to abortion. This focus on abortion rather than reproductive rights as a whole reflects the class and race biases of the second wave feminist movement. Privileged women were most interested in access to birth control, while economically disadvantaged and racially targeted women were often concerned with the right to _have_ children: freedom from forced sterilization, for example.

This does not mean that abortion is not an important issue in feminist politics, but that feminist reproductive politics must include ALL reproductive rights - including the right to choose to bear children - as well as access to women's healthcare across class lines.

### 6: Beauty Within and Without

Challenging sexist thinking about the female body is one of the major contributions feminism had on women's consciousness. Feminism is an assertion that women and men should be able to freely choose what they want to wear, and love their bodies just the way they are. It broke down the pathology of the modern eating disorder as a uniquely Western disease linked to the way society judges female bodies, and how women are economically exploited by advertisers who encourage low self-esteem in order to boost sales.

These theories prompted capitalist backlash as the cosmetic and fashion industry feared that feminism would destroy their business. This resulted in mass media campaigns that trivialized women's liberation by portraying feminists as "big, hyper masculine, and just plain old ugly." In reality, feminists are just regular women, like all women: diverse, big, small, young, old, and human.

### 7: Feminist Class Struggle

For bell hooks, feminist liberation MUST include social change that challenges class elitism. It means nothing to poor women if well-educated wealthy women begin to achieve equal access to class power with their male counterparts, if those reforms do not also include a shared vision with women who do not have class privilege. A woman cannot claim to represent "all women" if it also by default condones the conditions for white supremacist ideology and class subordination.

### 8: Global Feminism

Feminism exists in a "white supremacist capitalist patriarchal Western culture" and is not immune from its power dynamics. At its inception, the feminist movement was not about women gaining freedom from patriarchal oppression globally. Instead, it was used by women of privilege to gain more class mobility - who then wanted to "reach out" to women of other cultures to "save" them from their oppression. All of this without a political commitment to end Western imperialist policies and transnational capitalism that are economically and militaristically oppressing these women.

A radical feminist perspective instead examines how sexist practices globally are linked non-hierarchically. Instead of saying, "your sexism is worse than ours, so we can save you," we can recognize "your symptoms of patriarchy are different from ours, but they are ALL bad and come from the same root - so we can all struggle together."

### 9: Women at Work

The emphasis of women gaining access to the workplace was a _huge_ point of contention in the early feminist movement. Imagine a bunch of white, middle class feminists chanting, "work will liberate you!" to a group of poor and working-class women who have _always_ worked for low wages and did not in any way feel "liberated" by that work.

While it is true that _economic self-sufficiency_ is needed for liberation, _work_ by itself does not liberate women from sexist oppression and does not even provide economic self-sufficiency for many poor working-class people. Feminist politics is also a politics of working-class people, male and female: addressing ways to reduce poverty and improve the material conditions for the poorest people in our society, many of whom happen to be female.

### 10: Race and Gender

For a long time, the feminist movement has ignored issues of race: The fact that in America, _whiteness_ is a manufactured and privileged category, and that any movement that ignores the unique impact of racial oppression of non-white women cannot claim to speak for women as a group. Feminist movements cannot continue to deny this difference and place the needs of white women over the needs of others.

### 11: Ending Violence

Domestic violence was one of the most positive interventions made by the contemporary feminist movement, and bell hooks draws attention to its connection with sexist oppression by calling it "patriarchal violence."

>The term "patriarchal violence" is useful because unlike the more accepted phrase "domestic
violence" it continually reminds the listener that violence in the home is connected to sexism and sexist thinking, to male domination. For too long the term domestic violence has been used as a "soft" term which suggests it emerges in an intimate context that is private and somehow less threatening, less brutal, than the violence that takes place outside the home. This is not so, since more women are beaten and murdered in the home than on the outside. Also most people tend to see domestic violence between adults as separate and distinct from violence against children when it is not.

### 12: Feminist Masculinity

For men, especially poor men, patriarchy is not all it's cracked up to be. While they were promised power over others, and taught to value themselves based on their capacity to dominate others, their reality is very different: Lack of jobs, unrewarding paid labor, and fear at the increased class power of women. For many men, these struggles have been channeled into a fight _against_ feminism (for example, the Men's Rights Movement).

What bell hooks is saying is that these men have indeed identified a problem both with second wave feminism and with the structure of our society - and that their problems are also fundamental feminist issues. The feminist movement has not always reflected the sexist oppression that men face, and anti-male anger has prevented the feminist movement from offering support to men and boys to help them understand how they are harmed by patriarchal masculinity and how they can liberate themselves through feminist politics.

For radical/intersectional feminists, individual men are not the problem. The problem is patriarchy, sexism, and male domination, which are supported both by individual men _and_ women, and by institutional structures and value systems such as capitalism, racism, and imperialism.

### 13: Feminist Parenting

Feminist parenting is not just about men taking a caregiving role in the home. It is about asserting the rights of children as human beings, instead of as the property of parents. It critiques the hierarchy of the home which condones adult violence against children, even when women are the primary culprits of this violence and the primary teachers of sexist value systems.

> In the hierarchies of white supremacist capitalist patriarchy, male domination of females
is condoned, but so is adult domination of children. And no one really wants to call attention to mothers who abuse.

Another problem with the early feminist movement was its exclusive focus on the parenting of girls, and the assumption that boys automatically "had it better" than girls in a sexist society. In reality, boy children are just as vulnerable as girl children to domination, and they are often subjected to abuse when their behavior does not conform to sexist masculinity.

> Children need to be raised in loving environments. Whenever domination is present love is lacking. Loving parents, be they single or coupled, gay or straight, headed by females or males, are more likely to raise healthy, happy children with sound self-esteem.

>  Ending patriarchal domination of children, by men or women, is the only way to make the family a place where children can be safe, where they can be free, where they can know love.

### 14: Liberating Marriage and Partnership

Feminism is not against marriage or heterosexual partnership. Feminism is against sexist-defined notions of partnership that are destructive to principles of equality and mutual respect. Feminist politics means breaking down the individual biases against men doing traditionally "female" work in the home, but it also means fighting for structural changes that _allow_ both parents to take an active role in the home. For example, feminist politics requires a critique and restructuring of the way we value work and spend time at work:

> Until we see major changes in the way work is structured time wise, we will not live in a world where life is designed to allow men the time and space to parent. In that world men might be more eager to parent. But until then, many working males who are overtired and underpaid
will all too willingly accept a woman doing all the child care, even if she is overtired and underpaid.

### 15: A Feminist Sexual Politic: An Ethics of Mutual Freedom

It's easy to forget that not so long ago, female sexual activity _always_ came along with a fear of pregnancy. The world of female sexuality was forever changed by dependable birth control. This does not mean that sexual freedom means sexual promiscuity; instead, it is a separation of sex and fear: fear of punishment, fear of male violence, and fear of pregnancy.

Feminist sexuality also means updating our value system, so that we understand that female sexuality and desirability is not defined by the ability to satisfy male needs. It also affects the male sexual experience, requiring that women let go of sexist notions of male sexual performance.

### 16: Total Bliss: Lesbianism and Feminism

Lesbianism and feminism are often thought of together, but just like being female does not make someone a feminist, being a lesbian does not make someone a feminist either. That said, lesbians have had an important role in the feminist movement, bringing a perspective that challenged the dominant heterosexual feminist theory and also brought to the forefront issues of race and class. Because they were part of an oppressed group that did not conform to mainstream standards, lesbians were more likely to tackle issues of race, class, homophobia, and the issue that feminism ignored the experience of male-identified people.

> Without radical lesbian input feminist theory and practice would never have dared to push against the boundaries of hetero-sexism to create spaces where women, all women, irrespective of their sexual identity and/ or preference, could and can be as free as they want to be.

### 17: To Love Again: The Heart of Feminism

Romantic love in patriarchal culture tells us that we can do "anything for love" - beat people, kill people out of passion, possess people, dominate people, and in general act violently to "protect" or "express" our love. Feminist love says that no, you can't do any of these things and still call it love. Nevertheless, bell hooks believes that the way we express love is a core feminist political issue.

> The heartbeat of our alternative vision is still a fundamental and necessary truth: there can be no love when there is domination.

> When we accept that true love is rooted in recognition and acceptance, that love combines acknowledgment, care, responsibility, commitment, and knowledge, we understand there can be no love without justice. With that awareness comes the understanding that love has the power to transform us, giving us the strength to oppose domination. To choose feminist politics, then, is a choice to love.

### 18: Feminist Spirituality

Feminist political movements are also concerned with giving us alternatives definitions of spirituality that go beyond patriarchal religious practices. While feminism does critique patriarchal spiritual structures like organized fundamentalist Christianity, it is not anti-spiritual. Feminism instead encourages us to represent god in diverse ways, including the feminine, and to separate our spirituality from domination and violence.

### 19: Visionary Feminism

Radical/visionary/intersectional feminism is a political commitment to work for reforms within the existing system while simultaneously working to undermine and overthrow that white supremacist capitalist patriarchal system. It is a commitment to work to replace our current culture of domination with a culture grounded in communalism and social democracy.

> In a universe where mutuality is the norm, there may be times when all is not equal, but the consequence of that inequality will not be subordination, colonization, and dehumanization.

> Feminist politics aims to end domination to free us to be who we are - to live lives where we love justice, where we can live in peace. Feminism is for everybody.
